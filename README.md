### Hi there 👋

I'm Arushi — online, I go by AMKS. 

I'm a student at UC Berkeley studying Computer Science and Economics. Go Bears! 🐻

I fill my time by:
- 🔬 Researching the intersection of ML/PL under [Prof. Koushik Sen](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ksen/?rnd=1658081729521)
- 🛠 Helping run Berkeley's collegiate hackathon, [Cal Hacks](https://calhacks.io)
- 📖 Teaching a handful of classes around Berkeley

I keep a living document about myself at [amks.me](https://amks.me) and put all my inane thoughts at [t.co/itsamks](https://twitter.com/itsamks).

In this github, you'll find a few different types of projects: fun hacks I built for me and my friends to mess around with, projects I built to learn something I didn't know before, and some projects that I hope would help a lot more people. 

Please ask me about any of these! Always happy to chat — reach me at [hi@amks.me](mailto:hi@amks.me).
